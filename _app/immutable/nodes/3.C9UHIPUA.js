		I&#39;ve programmed in almost every mainstream language, and my favorites are Rust, Python, Svelte and Dart.
		<br/><br/>
		I got my start in 2016, when I was 9 years old I found the Scratch visual scripting platform, and I was instantly hooked!
		Though after almost a year, I was starting to feel the limits of Scratch. So in early 2017, I picked up the Unity game engine along with C#.
		<br/><br/>
		Since then, I&#39;ve used almost every mainstream language, including Python, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, Go, Rust, Dart, and many more!
		I also tried out langauges like C, C++, and Haskell, but they just didn&#39;t stick with me like the others did.
		<br/><br/>
		Aside from programming, I&#39;ve also played music since late 2012, and picked up every instrument I can get my hands on!
		Including ukulele, guitar, bass, mandolin, fiddle, piano, and drums.</p>`;return{c(){a=h(),e=u("div"),e.innerHTML=i,this.h()},l(t){g("svelte-i9xjcp",document.head).forEach(r),a=p(t),e=f(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),v(e)!=="svelte-1jgztq0"&&(e.innerHTML=i),this.h()},h(){document.title="Evan Boatwright / About",y(e,"class","flex flex-row items-start")},m(t,s){o(t,a,s),o(t,e,s)},p:n,i:n,o:n,d(t){t&&(r(a),r(e))}}}class w extends d{constructor(a){super(),c(this,a,null,x,m,{})}}export{w as component};
